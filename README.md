# Flow
(demo: https://flow-app-vamzl.ondigitalocean.app/)

## Overview

Flow is a simple project management tool that helps you organize your tasks and projects using a Kanban board interface.
It was built to get some familiarity with react drag and drop and the inertia framework.

You can demo the app [here](https://flow-app-vamzl.ondigitalocean.app/).

Please do not try to use the demo for actual project management, since it's only up for demonstration purposes it's run on a
relatively slow server and requests are heavily throttled.

## Current Features

- **Kanban Board**: Organize your tasks into columns and move them around with a drag and drop interface."
- **Tags**: Categorize tasks with tags for easier filtering and organization.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes.
